\section*{Foreword}

Due to spending one week finding out that the nvcc version (4.X) on gpuXX and
docXX.idi.ntnu.no does not have the ``-dc''/``--relocatable-device-code=true
--compile'' flags which comes with the current version of nvcc (5.X) (at least
on linux distros), as well as not having had access to the lab, so that I could
turn on the machines I was testing on over SSH outside outside of TA hours, I
have not had time to finish what has been asked of me in this exercise.

I have not managed to finish two aspects of this, namely complete a version of
\textit{region_grow_kernel_shared()}, or do this report. I write this now Friday
night, the 31st of October, after 21:00.

Additional I also wish I would have had time to optimize the code better, since
other students I know have gotten better results than me.

My hope is that this report will prove my insight into the answers your
questions were designed to teach me, so that I may salvage some points while not
finishing as hoped due to these circumstances.


\section*{Problem 3, Comparing performance}
\begin{enumerate}[a)]

    \item \textit{Compare the performance of different block sizes for the two
GPU versions of region growing and for the two GPU versions of the ray
casting. Comment on the results.}

    \begin{enumerate}[I)]
        \item Grow Region comparison:
        While I did not finish \textit{region_grow_kernel_shared()} with the
implementation of the halo of voxels and region in shared memory, I did finish
the implementation of putting \textit{data} into shared memory.

    \end{enumerate}


    \item Compare the performance of the two different GPU versions and the CPU
version of region growing. Comment on the results.

    \item Compare the performance of the two different GPU versions and the CPU
version of ray casting. Comment on the results.

\end{enumerate}
