\section*{Problem 1, CUDA}
\begin{enumerate}[a)]

    \item
    \begin{enumerate}[I)]

        \item \textbf{CPU}: \\
A \textbf{C}entral \textbf{P}rocessing \textbf{U}nit (CPU), is (as the
name suggest) the main heavy-weight/heavy-duty versatile processing unit which
does not shy away from using a lot of power (Wattage) for completing its
calculations. CPUs also feature complicated (and power hungry) architectural
optimizations like pipelining, cache prediction, and out-of-order execution.

        \item \textbf{GPU}: \\
A \textbf{G}raphics \textbf{P}rocessing \textbf{U}nit (GPU), is a processing
unit meant for calculating, drawing, and rendering images at a high rate per
second. Flaws in the image can be more easily forgiven due to the high density
of pixels in a picture, which results in erroneous pixels not being very visible
to the naked human eye. \\

This makes the GPU more single-focused in its use. There are many applications
where the GPU will outperform a CPU, especially with regards to energy
efficiency, but a modern CPU is much more versatile than a GPU, allowing it to
accomplish a much broader range of applications so much faster that in some
cases it will win on energy-efficiency just because it finished the application
so much quicker. \\

Hence, its strength is focused on the throughput of the device, more so than on
the CPU, where the the accuracy of the results counts as well.

    \item Occupancy in CUDA is a metric for how effectively the \textbf{Grids}
(which consist of \textbf{Blocks}, which in turn consist of \textit{Warps}), are
utilized in the CUDA processor: $\text{Occupancy} = \frac{\text{Active
Warps}}{\text{Maximum Active Warps}}$

    \item A CUDA \textbf{Block} is a 2D subsection of a \textbf{Grid}, which in
turn consists of \textit{Warps}. Each Warp in turn consists of 32 threads, the
smallest SIMD
